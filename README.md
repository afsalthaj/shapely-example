## Shapely Testing
Using locally published version of Sam's Shapely with additional changes to support typeclass derivation using `Lazy` `InvariantAp` on generated generic shapes!
Also trying with shapeless scala3, however failed for case class fields with more than 32 fields with recursive inline error.
